# TCP Implementation: Reliable Data Transfer and Congestion Control

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) Tahoe, consisting of two separate programs: a sender and a receiver. 

The sender is responsible for transferring the file using TCP, sliding window, and congestion control mechanisms. The receiver acknowledges in-order packets received, buffers out of order packets, sends acknowledgement for the last in-order packet received upon received an out of order packet, and sends cumulative acknowdlegement for when a sequence of packets becomes in-order. The sender retransmits packets after a timeout (using rtt estimation) and upon 3 duplicate acknowledgemen (fast-retransmit). The implementation of the congestion control will consists of the following features:
 <ul>
  <li>Slow-Start</li>
  <li>Congestion Avoidance</li>
  <li>Fast Retransmit (no Fast Recovery)</li>
 </ul>
 
 Additionally, the sender logs the changes in the congestion window (cwnd) along with the timestamp. Plot.py contains the script to graph cwnd against time.

## How to

1. Make file by running ```make```
2. (From the obj directory): ./rdt_receiver <port> <RECEIVE_FILE>
3. (From the obj directory): ./rdt_sender <hostname> <port> <FILE>

## To emulate it under different network conditions:

1. Install [mahimahi](http://mahimahi.mit.edu/)
2. mm-delay 10 mm-loss uplink 0.1 mm-link --meter-all channel_traces/rapidGold channel_traces/rapidGold
 
NOTE: The above command spawns a shell with a delayed, lossy link (with delay of 10 ms and uplink loss of 0.1). Read mahimahi documentation for different options available. The values can be altered. mm-link --meter-all uses trace files to emulate a variable cellular network and visualize the process's use of the network.
Different trace files have been provided but you may use your own or those that come with mahimahi. The visualizations include uplink and downlink queueing delays and throughputs.
  
## Plotting cwnd

After a successful run of the application, use the following from the tcp directory:
1. python3 plot.py -p log_cwnd.csv -n OUTPUT_FILE
  
NOTE: -p flag for path to cwnd logfile, -n flag for name of output file
